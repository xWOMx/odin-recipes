    <img src="../img/cauliflower.jpg">
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large cauliflower (leaves cut off), broken into pieces</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>4 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>100g strong cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp breadcrumbs, if you have them</li>

    </ul>
    <h2><em>Method</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then add 1 large cauliflower, broken into pieces, and cook for
            5 mins – lift out a piece to test, it should be cooked.</li>
        <li>Drain the cauliflower, then tip into an ovenproof dish. Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 7.</li>
        <li>Put the saucepan back on the heat and add 500ml milk, 4 tbsp flour and 50g butter.</li>
        <li>Keep whisking fast as the butter melts and the mixture comes to the boil – the flour will disappear and the
            sauce will begin to thicken. Whisk for 2 mins while the sauce bubbles and becomes nice and thick.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, stir in most of the 100g grated cheddar cheese and pour over the cauliflower. Scatter
            over the remaining cheese, and 2-3 tbsp breadcrumbs if using.</li>
        <li>Put in the oven and bake for 20 mins until bubbling.</li>

    </ol>
