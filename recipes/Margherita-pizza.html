        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>

        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong><em> For the topping</em></strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

    <h4><strong><em> To finish</em></strong></h4>

        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour
            in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with
            a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a
            thin crust.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to
            stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong> if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.
            On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
            The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking
            sheets.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Top and bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking
            tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with
            cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on
            top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive
            oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p></li>
